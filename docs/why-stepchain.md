# Why StepChain?

Every real system has **orchestration glue code**:

- “extract → transform → load” ETL jobs  
- “fetch → enrich → push” API calls  
- “validate → save → notify” business workflows  

Without structure, these pipelines quickly become:
- ❌ Nested try/except spaghetti  
- ❌ Repeated logging boilerplate  
- ❌ Retry logic scattered everywhere  
- ❌ Hard to test, hard to extend  

**StepChain** exists to fix that with a fluent, declarative API for pipelines—clean, explicit, and production-ready.
